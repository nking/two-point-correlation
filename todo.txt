-- low priority: one day, tidy up the project into multidimensional
   examples and the subset of them which are distributed by
   a member of the exponential family of distributions such as Poisson
   (by Central Limit Theorem as n becomes large, spatial point distribution 
   processes approach gaussian, so organize by number density too).
   -- include ML in the examples

-- consider adding to src/main/python/MoreClustering.py 
   consider adding VAE w/ normalizing flows (though computationally expensive
    unless using fast jacobians like triangular jacobians to make
    inverse of function faster):

    -- see NICE additive coupling layers.
       partitions latent variables z into 2 disjoint subsets, the 2nd of which
       becomes shifts of the first partition. the forward mapping
       results in det|Jacobian|=1
       so a neural network can use several NICE layers to be very expressive.
       - is volume preserving.
    -- see use of Real NVP which scales in addition to the shift of NICE:
    https://github.com/VincentStimper/resampled-base-flows
    https://pypi.org/project/normflows/
       - is not volume preserving.


-- explore the union of Fast DCov algorithm
   and sketches in a streaming context

-- LungCancer.ipynb : consider writing the k randomly sampled dataset indices 
   to a file in bin/test-classes and add a flag to read in the input.
   alternatively, can capture the random generator state and re-read it
   in optionally 

-- for LungCancer.ipynb consider adding some of the shap value variable interaction
plots for the variables that most affect the model.

-- for the Amazon Fine Food dataset, if want to explore variatonal auto-encoder
   latent space Z to compare that as a  non-linear projection to the
   SVD based projections, can use COO sparse matrices: tf.sparse.SparseTensor

-- edit the README.txt and documentation
-- update the wiki github io web pages
   -- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- though with very high dimensions the distances between points is
      not a good indicator for clustering.
-- need improvements in hist...

-- add back in some of the GEV context

-- consider 3-d tests and projection effects in critical separation
   threshold for clustering
