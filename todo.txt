-- add the nearest neighbors to the shared library
   and then implement the group finder method to use it.
-- move the knearest neighbors into shared library... 

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create a density curve as an alternative to histogram
   using knn with fixed number of points.
   -- for the knn, find the critical density
      relatonship:
      is it calculable from the GEV and density curve
      or approx it as smallest density value...
   -- (bishop 2006 pg 147 and before has examples showing
       representation of histogram, kde, knn for a dataset.
       need to explore determining k, V, and bin size for
       large range of data

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

-- update the javadocs
-- update coverage reports

-- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set
