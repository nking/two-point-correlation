-- for the point separation analysis,
   I'm currently using resampling to evenly spaced intervals
   then pyramidal wavelets to smooth,
   --> because that may increase the complexity too much for
       some datasets, will replace it with sparse implementation:
         -- adapt the pyramidal pattern for sparse point spacing:
            make new method for it that only includes points within
            a current bandwidth h for that wavelet level
            (the adapted convolution needs to be corrected, that is
             when reach the end of the bandwidth surrounding a point, 
             will need to 
             interpolate points for the endpoints.
             Then the bandwidth will be the same for all points, making 
             the error analysis easier.  That bandwidth is used for
             the normalization of each convolution result).
             NOTE that this alteration leads to the resulting smoothing
             being a hybrid of k nearest neighbors and also of KDE.
            -- need to keep track of the bandwidth for each wavelet
               invocation because it is needed for the errors.
-- edit the README.txt and documentation
-- update the wiki github io web pages
   -- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...
