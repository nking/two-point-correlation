-- need to change pixIdxs to longs everywhere
   starting with the shared library and then affected code.

-- in the cluster finder,
   need to make an alternate extraction of the background distance
   PDF for use when the distance transform is comparable to
   N_points^2
      use case: N_points = 3000
                a dist trans N_pix = 6500*5000 = 32,500,000
      -- considering random sampling of the void and determining the
         distance of nearest point.  the runtime complexity would 
         be closer to N_draws * log_2(N_points).
         - one caveat is that they are not maxima.

-- edit the README.txt and documentation
-- update the wiki github io web pages
   -- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...
