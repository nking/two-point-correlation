-- correct the PDFs and finish the tests

-- rewrite the one dbscan image unit test if missing since refactoring

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

-- update the javadocs
-- update coverage reports
-- update the wiki github io web pages
-- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- low priority future task:
   replace the result of a single critical density w/
   that of a critical density for x and y separately.
   - haven't thought this through yet, but
     the distance transforms for x and y directions 
     separately can be done and used after the
     critical density for the combined are found, then 
     using the same points deciding the combined critical
     density the separate can be calculated.
   - this change would make it easier to use on multiple
     dimensions and less sensitive to user applied scaling
     to data that are not naturally on same scales.
