-- add and use the disjoint forest label code

-- create a density curve as an alternative to histogram
   using knn with fixed number of points.
   -- for the knn, find the critical density
      relatonship:
      is it calculable from the GEV and density curve
      or approx it as smallest density value...
   -- (bishop 2006 pg 147 and before has examples showing
       representation of histogram, kde, knn for a dataset.
       need to explore determining k, V, and bin size for
       large range of data

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

-- update the javadocs
-- update coverage reports
-- increment version and deploy to nexus

-- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- continuing with use: 
      improve the histogram critical density solver and its tests
