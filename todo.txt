-- edit the README.txt and documentation
-- update the wiki github io web pages
   -- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

   Line-based recognition using a multidimensional Hausdorff distance

-- add back in some of the GEV context

-- consider 3-d tests and projection effects in critical separation
