-- need to revisit the portion of KDE critical density calculation
   that continues to add to weighted average for certain close spacing.
   -- consider inefficiently stored data that has large 
      x,y space between points within clusters and lower density
      than that in the regions outside of clusters.
      the current fixed values for some of the logic need revision.

-- rewrite the one dbscan image unit test if missing since refactoring

-- add the Knearest neighbors to the shared library
   and 1D wavelets

   -- implement the knn density curve using
      the knn imported into the shared library
   -- (bishop 2006 pg 147 and before has examples showing
       representation of histogram, kde, knn for a dataset.
       need to explore determining k, V, and bin size for
       large range of data

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

-- update the javadocs
-- update coverage reports
-- update the wiki github io web pages

-- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set
