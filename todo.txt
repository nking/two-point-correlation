-- for the point separation analysis,
   I'm currently using resampling to evenly spaced intervals
   then pyramidal wavelets to smooth,
   --> because that may increase the complexity too much for
       some datasets, will replace it with sparse implementation:
         -- adapt the pyramidal pattern for sparse point spacing:
            make new method for it that only includes points within
            a current bandwidth h for that wavelet level
            (the adapted convolution needs to be corrected, that is
             when reach the end of the bandwidth surrounding a point, 
             will need to 
             interpolate points for the endpoints.
             Then the bandwidth will be the same for all points, making 
             the error analysis easier.  That bandwidth is used for
             the normalization of each convolution result).
             NOTE that this alteration leads to the resulting smoothing
             being a hybrid of k nearest neighbors and also of KDE.
            -- need to keep track of the bandwidth for each wavelet
               invocation because it is needed for the errors.
-- in the documentation, espec on the wiki, edit the discussion
   of point spacings and point associations:
     -- add back some of the explanation of poisson distribution
        of void points and the resulting generalized extreme value
        curve peak, along w/ brief discussion of that as background
        density and a typical threshold above error being 2.5 sigma.
        - emphasize that at best, the runtime complexity for that
          approach is O(N^2) and provide the details.
     -- add back a discussion about the distance transform
        based emthod that was just refactored out of code:
          the maxima in the distance transform of void points
          giving a somewhat fast separation distance.
          resembles parts of LDA and SVM
      -- add details of current logic for the separation distance
         -- add details for the definition of cluster as being
            pairwise association .lte. the separation distance.
            this definition of cluster membership differs among
            some cluster algorithms.
-- edit the README.txt and documentation
-- update the wiki github io web pages
   -- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...
