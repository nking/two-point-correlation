-- need to revisit the portion of KDE critical density calculation
   that continues to add to weighted average for certain close spacing.
   
   need to canonicalize the data so that simple rules for
     finding the critical peak can be applied

   -- first step is that re=gridding of the data may be necessary
      if the peak of frequency of distance transform is not for
      distance of 1.
      this happens when the data have spacings larger than 1.

      Note, that the analysis may apply the same factor to the 
      x and y axis, but never a different factor to each.
      it's assumed that the user has already prepared the relative
      scalings and offsets as needed.
      (might provide a utility class to wrap frequencies of x spacings
      and y spacings for the user to help them re-scale their data.)

   -- the second correction needed is to learn the surface
      density resolution which is currently fixed at 0.05.
      THIS is in progress.

-- rewrite the one dbscan image unit test if missing since refactoring

-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

-- update the javadocs
-- update coverage reports
-- update the wiki github io web pages

-- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set
