-- more KDE:
   -- add a class to:
      -- accept point indexes, width, height given to 2ptcorr cluster finder
      -- internally, calculates new distance transform 
         from the points which are not in the given points list.
      -- extracts the densities from new distance transform of them
      -- gets the DensityHlder from 2ptcorr clustering (already done)
      -- calculates probability for each new point by
            finding the normalized count in density holder for the
            nearest density, then subtract that from 1.
            -- consider including errors from the density curve, via sums in
               wuadrature of the wavelet coefficients.
               -- if/when add this, add a field for it to the
                   DensityHolder
      -- create a list of the probabilities
         and plot confidence intervals over the clusters' xy plot

-- rewrite the one dbscan image unit test if missing since refactoring

-- consider changing default option to KDE

-- add the Knearest neighbors to the shared library
   and 1D wavelets

   -- implement the knn density curve using
      the knn imported into the shared library
   -- (bishop 2006 pg 147 and before has examples showing
       representation of histogram, kde, knn for a dataset.
       need to explore determining k, V, and bin size for
       large range of data


-- this project needs 2 different builds and the explanation
   added to both added to README.txt and a note considering 
   mvn to make version control clearer.
   (1) build including shared and trove
   (2) build excluding shared and trove
   -- add the dependency information to the build missing the
      shared class files

-- create ability for multiple dimensions
   -- that is n^2/2 number of dts and/or knn
-- need improvements in hist...

-- update the javadocs
-- update coverage reports
-- update the wiki github io web pages

-- redo a couple of "other" snapshots on two-pt-correl web page:
   the dbscan and the curved arrow from the finnish data set
